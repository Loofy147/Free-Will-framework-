# Comprehensive Task Prompt: Full-Spectrum Volitional Simulation

**Targeted Prompt:**
ROLE: Principal Architect of Neuro-Computational Agency (Post-Doc, MIT/Max Planck).
MISSION: Orchestrate a "Full-Spectrum Volitional Simulation" by unifying Individual FWI, Social Volition, and Biological Neuro-correlates into a recursive, safety-governed pipeline.

TASK SPECIFICATIONS:

1. **Biological Neuro-Correlate Modeling:**
   - Implement `BiologicalSignalSimulator` in `free_will_framework.py`.
   - Map FWI components to simulated BOLD signals:
     - Causal Entropy (CE) -> dlPFC (Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex) activity.
     - Metacognition (MA) -> ACC (Anterior Cingulate Cortex) conflict monitoring.
     - Integration (Phi) -> Parietal-Frontal integration index.
   - Formula: `BOLD(t) = (FWI_component * Gain) + GaussianNoise(sigma=0.05)`.

2. **Social-Individual Integration:**
   - Integrate `CollectiveAgency` into `IntegratedVolitionSystem`.
   - Calculate `DemocraticVolition (DV)`: Correlation between collective action collapse and individual preference vectors.
   - Calculate `SynergyIndex`: `FWI_collective / mean(FWI_individuals)`.

3. **Recursive Evolutionary Safety (RSI):**
   - Implement an `EvolutionaryLoop` that performs weight-tuning updates every 10 cycles.
   - Integrate `RSI_CircuitBreaker`: Halt evolution if capability (measured via Counterfactual Depth) increases > 85% in a single jump (Safety Anomaly 1).

4. **Global Volition Benchmark:**
   - Execute a simulation with 10 agents over 50 steps.
   - Generate a `VolitionCorrelationMatrix`: Individual FWI vs. Social Synergy vs. BOLD Fidelity.

**Success Criteria:**
- FWI-Biological Correlation R² > 0.80.
- Simulation runs to completion with active RSI safety monitoring.
- Output: `GLOBAL_MISSION_STATUS.json` containing the correlation matrix and evolution logs.

**Q Calculation:**
- P: 0.99 (Principal Architect, MIT/Max Planck)
- T: 0.99 (Neural mapping, BOLD modeling, RSI safety)
- F: 0.98 (Integrated JSON + Code + Metrics)
- S: 0.99 (Exact anatomical mappings, RSI jump limits, R² targets)
- C: 0.96 (Safety halt logic, single-jump constraints)
- R: 0.96 (Synergy and correlation analysis)
**Q = 0.99 * 0.99 * 0.98 * 0.99 * 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.876**
