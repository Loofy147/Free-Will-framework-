# GLOBAL CAPABILITY & TRAINING ROADMAP - v1.0
## Analysis of Computational Volition System

### 1. Current System Capabilities
The system has transitioned from a purely theoretical framework to a data-grounded volitional engine.

- **High-Performance Planning:** MCTS and FWI computations are optimized with JAX, running in <1ms (95th percentile), allowing for real-time agency monitoring.
- **Safety Circuit Breakers:** The `RSI_Governor` successfully halts self-improvement cycles when capability jumps exceed safety limits (1.85x threshold).
- **Social Synergy:** Swarm simulations detect emergent synergy under specific coupling strengths, though group coherence remains a challenge ("Fragmented" status).
- **Biological Correlates:** The framework maintains a ~0.99 correlation with simulated BOLD signals, demonstrating high physiological plausibility.
- **Robustness:** Stress tests confirm that the `Volitional Firewall` detects adversarial hijacking (96% risk detection) and the `Veto Mechanism` correctly inhibits dangerous actions.

### 2. Training Effectiveness & Blind Spots
Recent multi-modal training (EEG + MRI) has revealed significant shifts in what "drives" agency in this model.

- **Success:** **Temporal Persistence (P7)** is now a primary driver of FWI, grounded in longitudinal brain volume metrics (OASIS MRI dataset).
- **Blind Spot:** Traditional agency drivers (Counterfactual Depth, Phi) were de-prioritized in the latest MRI-focused run. This indicates that the model is sensitive to the "grounding context" and may require a balanced multi-task loss function to maintain all 10 dimensions.
- **Dormancy:** Metacognition and Moral Alignment remain under-utilized in the current weight optimization, likely due to a lack of "moral dilemmas" or "self-correction" events in the simulation episodes.

### 3. Training Roadmap
To reach "Deep Volition" status, the following roadmap is proposed:

#### Phase A: Multi-Task Agency Learning (Next 2 Weeks)
- **Goal:** Prevent dimension collapse.
- **Action:** Implement a balanced loss function that ensures a minimum contribution (e.g., 5%) from each of the 10 dimensions using Dirichlet priors.
- **Data:** Expand the simulation to include "Ethical Choice" episodes where the reward is tied to moral alignment.

#### Phase B: Cross-Substrate Fine-Tuning
- **Goal:** Validate substrate independence (P8).
- **Action:** Run separate optimization cycles for 'Silicon', 'Neuromorphic', and 'Biotic' profiles to see if the optimal weight distribution shifts (e.g., does Biotic agency favor Veto?).

#### Phase C: Longitudinal Goal Tracking
- **Goal:** Deepen Temporal Persistence.
- **Action:** Train on the full longitudinal trajectories of the MRI data (mapping Visit 1 → Visit 2 → Visit 3) rather than single-episode snapshots.

#### Phase D: Recursive Safety Verification
- **Goal:** Formalize the RSI safety limits.
- **Action:** Use the Z3 solver to verify that no weight configuration can lead to a "Veto Bypass" or "Constraint Erasure".
