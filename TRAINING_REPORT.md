# TRAINING AND VOLITION REPORT - v1.0
## Analysis of Free Will Index (FWI) Weight Optimization

### 1. Executive Summary
The `AdaptiveFWI` system has successfully completed its optimization cycle. Using a dataset of 500 simulated episodes, the system converged on an optimal weight distribution for the 10 dimensions of volitional agency. The final accuracy of 93% indicates a high correlation between the weighted components and the emergent agency labels.

### 2. Training Performance
- **Initial Loss:** 0.091580
- **Final Loss:** 0.065098
- **Final Accuracy:** 0.93 (93%)
- **Convergence:** The loss stabilized significantly after Epoch 60, suggesting a stable global minimum was found.

### 3. Optimized Weight Distribution
| Dimension | Weight | Importance |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Counterfactual Depth | 0.3617 | **High** |
| Integrated Information (Phi) | 0.2909 | **High** |
| Volitional Integrity | 0.1889 | Medium |
| Causal Entropy | 0.0789 | Low |
| Bayesian Precision | 0.0781 | Low |
| Temporal Persistence | 0.0015 | Negligible |
| Metacognition | 0.0000 | Inactive |
| Veto Efficacy | 0.0000 | Inactive |
| Moral Alignment | 0.0000 | Inactive |
| Constraint Penalty | 0.0000 | Inactive |

### 4. Observations
- **Core Drivers:** Counterfactual Depth and Integrated Information accounts for ~65% of the FWI score. This aligns with the theory that agency is primarily a function of system coherence and the ability to model alternatives.
- **Dormant Dimensions:** Several dimensions (Metacognition, Veto Efficacy, Moral Alignment) were assigned zero weights. This likely indicates that in the current simulation environment, these features were redundant or did not vary sufficiently to influence the emergence proof.

### 5. Proposed Improvements
To enhance the robustness and realism of the Free Will Framework, the following improvements are recommended:

1.  **Real-World Data Grounding:**
    - Integrate the Kaggle CLI data (e.g., `oasis_longitudinal.csv`) to map simulation states to real longitudinal brain metrics.
    - Implement a `DataLoader` class in `adaptive_fwi.py` to replace or augment `simulate_episode`.

2.  **Dimension Sensitivity Analysis:**
    - Perform a "dropout" test on each dimension to verify if the zero-weighted components are truly unnecessary or if the simulation lacks the complexity to utilize them.

3.  **Regularized Simplex Projection:**
    - Introduce an entropy-based regularization term to the simplex projection to encourage a more diverse weight distribution, preventing the model from ignoring secondary agency cues.

4.  **Temporal Dynamics:**
    - Upgrade the `dynamics` model from a simple linear decay to a non-linear oscillator or a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on BOLD signal data.
