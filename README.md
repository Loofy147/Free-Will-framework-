# Computational Free Will Framework

A mathematically rigorous framework for modeling volitional agency and emergent free will.

## Overview

This project implements a computational substrate for volitional agency, providing a quantitative metric called the **Free Will Index (FWI)**. The framework demonstrates how free will can emerge from deterministic processes through recursive self-modeling and counterfactual reasoning.

## Key Features

- **Free Will Index (FWI):** A composite metric integrating seven dimensions:
  - Causal Entropy (Action freedom)
  - Integrated Information (System coherence)
  - Counterfactual Depth (Alternative possibilities)
  - Metacognitive Awareness (Self-modeling)
  - Veto Efficacy (Free Won't)
  - Bayesian Precision (Reliable belief updating)
  - External Constraints (Physical/Constitutional bounds)
- **Emergence Proof:** Computational verification of compatibilist free will.
- **Bayesian Agency:** Precision-weighted belief updating based on the Free Energy Principle.
- **Quantum-Inspired Extension:** Superposition of action policies until measurement (collapse).
- **High Performance:** JAX-accelerated and Sparse Lanczos calculations for spectral decomposition and quantum evolution.
- **Scalability:** Hierarchical adaptive sampling for Causal Entropy, enabling $O(n \log n)$ complexity.
- **AI Safety Monitor:** Real-time tracking of volitional health with anomaly detection for sudden FWI drops (P4).
- **Biologically Grounded:** Optimized via Bayesian optimization on synthetic datasets with RP onset and BOLD correlates (P3).

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy scipy networkx jax jaxlib
```

## Usage

Run the main simulation:
```bash
python free_will_framework.py
```

Run the unit tests:
```bash
python test_free_will.py
```

## Theoretical Grounding

The framework bridges the gap between compatibilist philosophy and computational neuroscience, addressing the "hard problem" of why deterministic computation can feel like free choice through the lens of Gödelian incompleteness and recursive uncertainty.
